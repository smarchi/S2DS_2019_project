# S2DS 2019 London project

Science to Data Science (S2DS) is a bootcamp that provides to analytical PhDs with the commercial and technical skills to make the transition from academia to the data science industry.

During the S2DS 2019 London version of the program, three other PhDs and I performed We worked SMRS, a company that provides online advertising services for higher education institutions in the UK. In particular, we modeled and predicted the success of advertising campaigns from several metrics.

This repository contains some of the scripts and notebooks that we developed during the bootcamp. The files in this repository are not the final product we provided to the company. The purpose of this repository is to use the project material to keep making tests of different algorithms and ideas.
